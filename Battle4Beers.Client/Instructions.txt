WELCOME TO B4B, MY FELLOW BEER LOVER!!!

SO, THE SITUATION WHERE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND DON'T KNOW
WHO SHOULD BUY A BEER FOR THE OTHER HAS OCCURED TO YOU TOO, EH?

WELL, DON'T WORRY, WE WILL NOW FIND OUT!

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

PRESS THE "NEW GAME" OPTION IN THE MENU 
AND SELECT THE GAME TYPE YOU WANT TO PLAY.

THEN, EACH PLAYER NEEDS TO TYPE HIS OWN UNIQUE NAME!
(NAMES MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, SO DON'T COPY!)

AFTER EVERYONE ENTERS A NAME, EACH PLAYER WILL SELECT HIS HERO
AND CLASS TYPE. THERE ARE 3 HERO TYPES AND FOR EACH TYPE,
THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT CLASS TYPES, EACH WITH 4 ACTIONS,
WHICH MATCH THEIR CLASS CHARACTER.

HERO AND CLASS TYPES:

1. WARRIORS:
ALL WARRIORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO HIT THEIR OPPONENTS WITH THEIR WEAPONS.
  -SWORDMASTER WARRIOR:
     -THE SWORDMASTER HAS THE PASSIVE ABILITY "CRITICAL STRIKE".
     AFTER LEVELING IT UP, THE PLAYER HAS 35% CHANCE OF DOUBLE DAMAGE
     FOR THE REST OF THE GAME.
     -SWORDMASTER HAS THE ABILITY "MIRROR IMAGE" WHICH DAMAGES AND STUNS
     THEIR TARGET FOR 1 TURN.
     -AWESOMEST ABILITY IS "WINDFURY" WHICH DEALS LOTS OF DAMAGE AND CAN
     CRITICALLY STRIKE FOR DOUBLE DAMAGE!!!
  -BERSERKER WARRIOR:
     -THE BERSERKER'S PASSIVE ABILITY IS "GO BERSERK".
     THIS ABILITY MAKES HIS DAMAGE DEAL DOUBLE THE AMOUNT FOR 3 TURNS,
     BUT COSTS HIM 200 HEALTH, SO BE CAUTIOUS!
     -THE BERSERKER HAS THE ABILITY TO USE WILD AXES WHICH DEALS LOTS OF DAMAGE.
     -AWESOMEST ABILITY IS "EXECUTE". THE BERSERKER EXECUTES HIS TARGET IF HIS HP
     IS BELOW 700.
     ---OH, DID I MENTION THAT THE BERSERKER HAS THE MOST OP PASSIVE OF ALL?
     HE HAS BUILT-IN 15% CRITICAL CHANCE WHICH CAN OCCUR AT ANY AGRESSIVE ACTION!
   -PROTECTION WARRIOR:
     NEED A TANK? GOTEM!
     -THIS WARRIOR STARTS WITH 300 EXTRA ARMOR AND CAN GIVE 300 ARMOR
     TO HIS TEAMMATES OR HIMSELF.
     -HE HAS THE ABILITY "HIBERNATE" WHICH HEALS HIM FOR LOTS AND GIVES HIM
     50% DAMAGE REDUCTION FOR THE NEXT TURN.
     -HE ALSO HAS THE ABILITY "SHIELD SLAM" WHICH DAMAGES THE OPONENT FOR HIS
     CURRENT ARMOR. "OH, BUT WHAT IF HIS ARMOR IS 0?" YOU MIGHT SAY.
     TREAD LIGHTLY, MY BEER FRIEND, HE ALSO STUNS THE ENEMY FOR 1 TURN!
2. MAGES:
ALL MAGES HAVE A BASIC FIRST ABILITY WHICH DAMAGES A TARGET FOR THE
AMOUNT OF THEIR CURRENT SPELLPOWER.
   -ARCANE MAGE:
     -THE ARCANE MAGE HAS THE ABILITY TO "AMPLIFY" HIS "MAGIC", WHICH
     DOUBLES HIS CURRENT SPELL POWER FOR 3 TURNS.
     -THIS MAGE CAN CAST "POLYMORPH" ON HIS TARGET, AND STUN HIM FOR
     3 TURNS! (CAUTION, THIS HAS A BIG COOLDOWN!)

     -THE FIRE MAGE HAS THE ABILITY TO GAIN LOTS OF ARMOR AND HEAL HIMSELF

     A BIG COOLDOWN.
     -THE FIRE MAGE CAN CAST THE SPELL "PYROBLAST" TO DAMAGE THE TARGET
     FOR TONS OF DAMAGE!
     USING PYROBLAST LOWERS THE TARGET'S HP SIGNIFICANTLY AND IN MOST CASES
     OPENS UP THE CHANCE FOR HIS AWESOMEST ABILITY - "INCINERATE"!

     AAAAND, CHECK THIS OUT, REDUCES ALL HIS COOLDOWNS BY 1!!! (AMAZING, RIGHT?)
     -WAIT, WHERE IS THE CC? HOLD ON, DON'T MAKE ME A LIAR!
     FROST MAGE CAN USE "FROZEN GROUND" TO DAMAGE HIS OPPONENT AND STUN HIM FOR 2 TURNS!
3. PRIESTS:
ALL PRIESTS HAVE THE ABILITY "FLASH HEAL" SO THAT ANY PRIEST CAN PROVIDE HEALING.
(IT'S A PRIEST'S JOB TO HEAL, DUH)

      CAST "SERENITY" TO HEAL YOUR ALLY TARGET FOR TONS OF HEALTH!
     -WAIT WHERE IS THE DAMAGE?
      THREAD LIGHTLY I SAID, HOLY PRIEST HAS THE ONE DAMAGING ABILITY -
      "PUNISH THE UNHOLY" WHICH DAMAGES HIS TARGET FOR LOTS AND LOTS OF DAMAGE!
   -DISCIPLINE PRIEST

     CAUSING THEM TO LOSE 3 TURNS. (HAS BIG COOLDOWN)
